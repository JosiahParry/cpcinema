# cpcinema

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

cpcinema is intended to extract color palettes from the images posted by the Instagram account [\@colorpalette.cinema](https://www.instagram.com/colorpalette.cinema/). \@colorpalette.cinema takes stills from beautiful filmed and edited cinema pieces and creates a color palette containing 10 colors from the still. `cpcinema` extracts the hexcodes from one of their posts (or any image with 10 equally spaced out colors at the bottom).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JosiahParry/cpcinema")
```
## extracting and crafting color palettes

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/88916975_231750381202013_35436369220443926_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=cVqcSi58uZ4AX_hJXfm&oh=e56453cf87265c2cd2079f4c8fedacb0&oe=5EAC0A60")
```
This still from the Joker (2019) contains a beautiful palette which seems like it may be suitable as a diverging color palette. We can extract these hex codes using `extract_cpc_pal()`. Note that the print method is not effectively displayed in the README. 

```{r example}
library(cpcinema)

img_path <- "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/88916975_231750381202013_35436369220443926_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=cVqcSi58uZ4AX_hJXfm&oh=e56453cf87265c2cd2079f4c8fedacb0&oe=5EAC0A60"

(joker <- extract_cpc_pal(img_path))
```

Moreover, we are able to actually generate color palettes with more or less values than is available in our palette with the `color_palette()` function. 

```{r}
colors <- c("#842000", "#EC9B01", "#3F5D91")
color_palette(colors, n = 3)
```


`color_palette()` has three arguments `pal`, `n`, and `type`. `pal` expects a character vector of hexcodes. `n` we specify how many colors from the palette should be selected. If `n` is omitted, it is the same number of values as in the palette. If it is larger than the length of `pal`, you will be prompted to change the `type` argument. There are two different arguments for `type`. These are `discrete` (the default) and `continuous`. When `type = "continuous"` we are indicating that interpolation of the colors needs to be performed.

For example, we can take the palette from above and interpolate 7 more colors by setting `n = 10` and `type = "continuous"`. 

```{r}
colors_10 <- color_palette(colors, n = 10, "continuous")
```

```{r}
ggplot(wesanderson::heatmap, aes(x = X2, y = X1, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = color_palette(joker, n = 100, "continuous")) + 
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  coord_equal() +
  labs(x = "", y = "") 

```


Pretty cool, huh? We can take those 10 colors and extract only 5 of them by setting `n = 5`.

```{r}
color_palette(colors_10, 5)
```

Moreover, if you'd prefer to select them manually, you can do that as well using bracket `[` indexing. 

```{r}
colors_10[c(1, 3, 6, 9)]
```

## available palettes

There are also 12 available palettes for you right away. These are acessible through the list object `available_pals`.

This package implements an S3 `cpcinema` class using `vctrs`. The class `cpcinema` contains a `Crayon` style in the attributes for each colorâ€”this is what enables the fun printing. `cpcinema` objects will be coerced to character vectors when needed. Otherwise you can cast them explicitly with `as.character()`. To extract the `crayon` styles use `palette_style()`.

```{r}
pal <- color_palette(colors)

palette_style(pal)
```

### acknowledgments

This package was inspired by [\@karthik's](https://github.com/karthik/) [`wesanderson`](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) package. Additionally, [\@jesseadler's](https://github.com/jessesadler/) [`debvectrs`](https://github.com/jessesadler/debvctrs) presentation at rstudio::conf(2020L) and repository helped tremendously in getting the footing for the `vctrs` classes.
